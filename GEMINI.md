## ‚ú¶ Gemini CLI

The [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) is an interactive command-line interface that leverages large language models to assist with software engineering tasks, including code generation, refactoring, and documentation.

## üìñ Project Overview

HoHatch is an application designed for converting image formats, specifically between JPG and DDS, primarily for use with Special K. It is distributed as an executable.

HoHatch is a Windows-only application.

### ‚ú® Core Functionality

1. **JPG to DDS Conversion**: Convert modded JPG images to DDS format and move them into the `Special K/Profiles/Shadowverse Worlds Beyond/SK_Res/inject/textures` folder for injection.
2. **DDS to JPG Conversion**: Convert DDS images extracted from the `Special K/Profiles/Shadowverse Worlds Beyond/SK_Res/dump/textures/ShadowverseWB.exe` folder (using Special K's dump feature) to JPG format.

### ‚ú® Detailed Features

The application features a **Main Screen** for image conversion and a **Settings Screen** accessible from the Main Screen.

#### Main Screen

- Displays thumbnails of images in two sections: "Dumped DDS Images" (from the game) and "Injected DDS Images" (for modding).
- **Image Selection**: Users can click on images to select them for batch operations.
- **Batch Actions**: A footer menu appears when images are selected, allowing users to:
  - **Download Selected**: Convert all selected DDS images to JPG and save them to a chosen folder.
  - **Trash Selected**: Delete all selected DDS files from their respective folders.
- **Individual Image Actions**: Each image card has buttons for:
  - Downloading the DDS as a JPG.
  - Replacing the DDS file with a new JPG.
  - Deleting the DDS file.
- **Pagination**: Both image sections have pagination to handle a large number of files.

#### Settings Screen

- **Language Toggle**: Switch between English (`en`) and Japanese (`ja`).
- **Special K Folder Path**: Provides a `Download` button to download [the Special K setup application](https://sk-data.special-k.info/SpecialK.exe) to the current directory.
- **Texconv Executable Path**: Provides a `Download` button to download [the Texconv executable](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/releases/latest/download/texconv.exe) to the current directory.
- **Image Output Dimensions**: Allows users to enter a desired height for converted images; the width is automatically calculated as 53/64 times the height and displayed as non-editable.

#### `settings.json` Location

For applications that are open to the general public, it is most appropriate to store the `settings.json` in the user data directory `C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Local\HoHatch\settings.json`. This allows each user to have his/her own settings and avoids permission issues.

### üìù Image Format Note

Due to known issues with `texconv`, this application exclusively supports JPG files for conversion (and does not support PNG files).

## üõ†Ô∏è Codebase Structure

This section outlines the main components and technologies used in the HoHatch project.

- **Frontend**
  - `frontend/`: This directory houses the modern UI, developed using PyWebView, React (with Jest), and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**
  - `backend/`: PyWebView
- **Documentation**
  - [`frontend/docs/FEATURES.md`](https://github.com/dracoboost/hohatch/blob/master/frontend/docs/FEATURES.md): Features of HoHatch Application
  - [`website/docs/FEATURES.md`](https://github.com/dracoboost/hohatch/blob/master/website/docs/FEATURES.md): Features of HoHatch Website
- **Support Website**
  - The support website is built with React on Vercel.

## Development Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pre-Commit Preflight Checks**
> Before every `git commit`, you must run the preflight checks in both the `frontend` and `website` directories to ensure stability and catch errors early. This is a mandatory step to prevent CI/CD pipeline failures.
>
> ```sh
> # From the frontend directory
> cd frontend
> npm run preflight
>
> # From the website directory
> cd ../website
> npm run preflight
> ```

This section provides essential guidelines for contributing to the HoHatch project, covering building, testing, and coding standards.

## üå± Git Repository

The main branch for this project is called `master`.

## üé® Code Design Principles

### üèõÔ∏è Service-Oriented Architecture

The backend is structured with a service-oriented architecture, where distinct services handle specific concerns (e.g., configuration, file operations, image processing). This improves modularity, testability, and maintainability.

### üß© Feature Separation

Improve reusability, maintainability, and readability by creating components and structures for frequently occurring structures.

### üõ°Ô∏è Ensuring Consistency

Improve readability and maintainability, and strengthen security by ensuring consistency in hash functions, environment variable names, and error handling.

### üêõ Step-by-step Debugging

Resolve multiple errors one by one. Identify the root cause.

### üîß Maintainability

Actively structure and functionalize code for maintainability.
