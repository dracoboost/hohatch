## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.4] - 2025-09-06

### Added

- Modified `scripts/version_management/manager.py` to ensure `backend/version.py` is correctly updated.
- Fixed regex pattern for version badge in `README.md` to ensure accurate matching.

### Changed

- Simplified `backend-test` and `lint:fix` scripts in `package.json`.

- Updated `freeze:windows` script to use `venv\Scripts\pip freeze > requirements.txt` for freezing dependencies.
- Updated `lint:fix:windows` script to use `npm exec prettier -- --write "**/*.{ts,tsx}" > NUL` to suppress output.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-31

- Modified `dev` script in `frontend/package.json` to also run `update-readme-version`.
- Changed all download links from direct `.exe` to the latest GitHub releases page in `README.md` and `frontend/README.md`.

### Fixed

- Resolved `TypeError: argument should be a str or an os.PathLike object where __fspath__ returns a str, not 'list'` by correcting `open_file_dialog` logic in `backend/src/api.py` to properly handle file dialog results.
