## 🐛 Bug Report

If you find a bug, please send a DM on [X (@dracoboost)](https://x.com/dracoboost), or join our Discord server to report it.
Alternatively, you can implement the feature on GitHub.

## Future Plans

- DDS ↔ PNG conversion is not yet implemented.
  When using `texconv` with PNG input, it often produces completely black output.
  Fixing this issue likely requires a fundamental change in the conversion pipeline, so it has been postponed for now.

## For Contributors

HoHatch is currently a solo project. Most of the core features I personally needed have already been implemented, but if you would like to add new features and are comfortable writing **Python** and/or **Next.js**, contributions are very welcome!
