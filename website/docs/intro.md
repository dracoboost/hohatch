# What is HoHatch?

**HoHatch** is a Windows desktop application designed to support MOD creation for [**Shadowverse: Worlds Beyond**](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/) (hereinafter referred to as "Worlds Beyond") using the Special K injection tool. It specializes in converting between JPG and DDS formats and managing DDS texture files.

For Worlds Beyond MOD creators, spending time on anything other than the actual artwork creation process can be very frustrating. The typical workflow for creating MOD images includes:

* Extracting original DDS files from the game using Special K
* Converting those DDS files to editable JPGs
* Editing/modifying the JPGs
* Converting the edited JPGs back to DDS format for injection

> [DirectDraw Surface (DDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface) is an image format that can store mipmaps (sets of textures at different resolutions) within a single file.

HoHatch was created to streamline and make the image conversion and file management part of this workflow as efficient and intuitive as possible, allowing creators to focus more on the creative artwork itself.

> **Are there MODs for Android and iOS?:** In general, mobile OSes have strong security restrictions that make app injection extremely difficult. Therefore, no MODs for Beyond are currently being developed for Android or iOS.

> **The initial release date:** HoHatch was first [released on GitHub](https://github.com/dracoboost/hohatch/tree/c94031b6fdacf581d5993a0c7be9bc4df188a04d) on August 29, 2025 and later [shared on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowverseMods/comments/1naxk3j/hohatch_streamline_shadowversewb_modding/) on October 5, 2025.
