# What is HoHatch?

HoHatch is a desktop application designed to streamline the image modding process for **Shadowverse: Worlds Beyond** when using the Special K tool.

It provides a simple, modern user interface to manage the conversion and injection of DDS image files, bridging the gap between the game's texture files and standard JPG images that are easy to edit.

## Key Features

- **View Dumped & Injected Images:** See thumbnails of images extracted from the game and images ready to be injected, all in one place.
- **Effortless Conversion:**
    - Convert in-game DDS textures to JPG format for easy editing.
    - Replace existing DDS files with your custom JPGs, with automatic conversion handled by the app.
- **Batch Operations:** Select multiple images to convert or delete them all at once.
- **Configurable Settings:** Adjust the output resolution of your images and configure application paths to fit your setup.

Whether you're extracting game assets to create new mods or injecting your custom creations, HoHatch is built to make the process faster and more intuitive.
