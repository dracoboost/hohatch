### 🖼️ Main Screen

On the main screen, thumbnails of both "dumped" DDS images (extracted from the game) and "injected" DDS images (converted from JPGs for modding) are displayed.  
You can perform individual actions on each image or select multiple for batch processing. The table below summarizes the key features available for managing these images.

| Feature | Description |

| Convert to JPG | Convert a single DDS image to JPG format and save it to a chosen location. |
| Replace DDS | Replace an existing DDS file with a new JPG image, converting it to DDS during the process. |
| Delete DDS | Permanently delete a single DDS file from its respective folder. |

### ⚙️ Settings Screen

On the settings screen, you can configure various settings for the application.

| Feature | Description |
