This release marks a complete overhaul of the HoHatch website, migrating from Next.js to Docusaurus for better documentation and content management.

### Key Changes:

- **New Docusaurus Backend**: The entire site has been rebuilt on Docusaurus, providing a more robust and scalable platform.
- **Revamped Homepage**: The homepage now features a modern two-column layout with theme-aware particle effects.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**:
  - The color mode switcher now toggles cleanly between light and dark modes.
  - Navbar icons are now theme-aware, switching between black and white variants.
  - The search bar has been repositioned for better accessibility.
- **SEO & Performance**:
  - Implemented `robots.txt` and automatic `sitemap.xml` generation.
  - Addressed all build warnings related to blog post truncation and tag definitions.
- **Bug Fixes**: Critical bugs related to component rendering (`useColorMode` crash) and configuration validation have been resolved.

This update significantly improves the maintainability, performance, and user experience of the HoHatch website.
